Welcome to ACAT's documentation!
==============================================
The Qualcomm Audio Coredump Analysis Tool (ACAT), is a Python-based
debugging tool for both Qualcomm Kymera TM Capability and Framework
code, which uses the Kymera framework on the DSP to analyze both Coredumps
and live-running chips.  ACAT has two modes:

 * **Automatic**: ACAT runs all analyses without further prompting (By
   calling the ``run_all()`` function). Results are outputted to a text or
   html file, or the Command Prompt window.

 * **Interactive**: This mode provides a real-time debugging facility.
   ACAT accepts Python commands and runs the selected analysis only.
