KSP Extract Script
------------------
KSP comes with a tool, ``ksp_extract.exe``, to extract streams and headers
from a ``lrw`` file, which contains data that comes from the KSP operator
in Kymera.

Normally, the extraction occurs when the KSP has finished receiving the
data. However, if KSP terminates prematurely the extraction fails, leaving
the ``lrw`` files in the output directory. In this case the
``ksp_extract.exe`` tool helps to extract audio/data from a ``lrw`` file.

The KSP installation puts ``ksp_extract.exe`` in the Scripts folder of the
Python Virtual Environment. By default, it should be in the Windows path
when the virtual environment is activated.

To get more help use ``--help`` switch, for example:::

    (ksp_env) PS <CURRENT PATH>> ksp_extract.exe --help
    usage: extract [-h] [--sample-rates SAMPLE_RATES [SAMPLE_RATES ...]] filename

    Kymera Stream Probe (KSP) extract tool. It extracts Audio/Data from a recorded
    KSP lrw file.

    positional arguments:
      filename              A recorded KSP lrw file.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --sample-rates SAMPLE_RATES [SAMPLE_RATES ...], -s SAMPLE_RATES [SAMPLE_RATES ...]
                            Space separated sample rates in integer. Valid sample
                            rates are between 8000 (8Khz) and 192000 (192Khz)
                            inclusive. The first Sample rate will be applied to
                            `Stream0`, the second one will be applied to `Stream1`
                            and so on. Extra Sample Rates will be ignored. i.e. If
                            the given lrw file has only two streams but three
                            sample rates are given, the third sample rate will be
                            ignored. If the sample rate is not provided, the
                            script will produce multi channel raw file instead of
                            wav file. Please note, in case of DATA type streams,
                            the script ignores sample rates.


KSP Reader Script
-----------------
KSP Reader tool, ``ksp_reader.exe``, is a script to receive Audio/Data
from a device and saves it into a LRW file.

Once the KSP operator is active and configured appropriately on the chip,
it sends out the data via an established connection. This tool is to
capture those data on the receiving end. For the best reading, activate
the script before starting the operator.  Otherwise, the reader may miss
some of the incoming data.

The KSP installation puts ``ksp_reader.exe`` in the Scripts folder of the
Python Virtual Environment. By default, it should be in the Windows path
when the virtual environment is activated.

To get more help use ``--help`` switch, for example:::

    (ksp_env) PS <CURRENT PATH>> ksp_reader.exe --help
    usage: reader.py [-h] [-w WAIT] [-t TRANSACTIONS] [-v] [--version]
                  trb_device output

    Kymera Stream Probe (KSP) TRB tool. It receives Audio/Data from a device URL
    and saves the output in a lrw file format.

    positional arguments:
      device                A device to read from. i.e. 'trb:scar:0'
      output                A filename which trb saves the data into it in LRW
                            format. If the file exists, it will be overwritten.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -w WAIT, --wait WAIT  The waiting time to receive data in seconds. This
                           value can be a decimal number. The application
                           terminates if within this time no data has received.
                           The default value is 3600 seconds or 1 hour.
      -t TRANSACTIONS, --transactions TRANSACTIONS
                            number of transaction to poll each time. The default
                            number is 100.
      --version             show program's version number and exit
