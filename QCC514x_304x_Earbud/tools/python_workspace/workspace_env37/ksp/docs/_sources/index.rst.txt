Welcome to KSP's documentation!
==============================================

Qualcomm® Kymera™ Stream Probe (KSP) is a debugging tool that enables
users of the audio subsystem to sniff audio/data from inside a running
graph in Qualcomm® Kymera. It can be used to probe and record internal
transforms of a graph.

Description of terms used in KSP
--------------------------------

  - *Stream*: KSP can sniff more than one channel (connection buffer). In
    KSP buffers are grouped into streams. All channels within a stream
    must be synchronized in real time. See Find transform IDs using ACAT
    section.
  - *Channel*: A channel has a one to one relation to a connection buffer. A
    stream can have up to 4 channels. All channels in the same stream must
    be synchronized, this means encoded streams can only have one channel.
    Streams that are configured with unsynchronized channels can cause the
    KSP operator to stall.

Limitations
-----------

The following limitations should be considered when using the application:

  - The chips supported are:

    - CSRA6810x
    - QCC302x/3x
    - QCC304x
    - QCC512x
    - QCC514x

  - Apps must be based on an ADK application.
  - A TRB connection must be available.
  - KSP cannot be active at the same time as TRB logging.
  - KSP does not support USB DBG as a transport interface.


Prerequisites
-------------

The prerequisites required to use KSP are:

  - One of the following python version:

    - Python 3.6 (64-bit).
    - Python 3.7 (64-bit).
    - Python 3.8 (64-bit).
    - Python 3.9 (64-bit).
