UUT
===

This provides low level access to a UUT (Unit Under Test) abstraction.


The functionality is divided into three main groups

   * message, for sending, receiving, send and receive messages, and installing message
     receive handlers. 
   * timer, for adding and removing absolute and relative timers which can be polled or
     notified with callbacks
   * memory access, for memory read and write to single or block memory locations.

Available methods are listed in :class:`kse.core.uut_base.UutBase`.

In the shell it is available as ``uut``::

    >>> uut.timer_get_time()
