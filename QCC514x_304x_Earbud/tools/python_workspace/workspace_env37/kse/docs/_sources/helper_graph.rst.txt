Graphs are container objects for :ref:`helper_endpoint`, :ref:`helper_stream` and
:ref:`helper_capability`.

Suported operations are:

   * :meth:`kse.kalsim.graph.graph.Graph.load` to load a graph configuration
   * :meth:`kse.kalsim.graph.graph.Graph.create` to create a graph based on the
     configuration provided
   * :meth:`kse.kalsim.graph.graph.Graph.config` to configure a graph
   * :meth:`kse.kalsim.graph.graph.Graph.connect` to connect all elements in a graph
   * :meth:`kse.kalsim.graph.graph.Graph.start` to start streaming
   * :meth:`kse.kalsim.graph.graph.Graph.check_active` to check if streams has finished
   * :meth:`kse.kalsim.graph.graph.Graph.stop` to stop streaming
   * :meth:`kse.kalsim.graph.graph.Graph.disconnect` to disconnect all elements in a graph
   * :meth:`kse.kalsim.graph.graph.Graph.destroy` to destroy a graph
   * :meth:`kse.kalsim.graph.graph.Graph.play` to play a graph, which essentially is execute all
     methods above in sequence

In the shell it is available as ``graph``
