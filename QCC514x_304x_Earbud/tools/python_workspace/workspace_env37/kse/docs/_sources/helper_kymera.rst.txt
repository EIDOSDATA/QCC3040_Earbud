.. _helper_kymera:

======
Kymera
======

This is the basic KATS language to firmware, through the Kymera API.

This helper is very similar to the internal kymera api with the differences

    * all commands are blocking (as opposed to report result through a callback)
    * there is no connection ID parameter.

Depending on the platform, the right kymera API adapter is loaded at start.

Available methods are listed in :class:`kse.kymera.kymera.kymera_base.KymeraBase`.

In the shell it is avaailable as ``kymera``::

    >>> kymera.opmgr_create_operator(1)
    0x4040
    >>> kymera.opmgr_get_opid_list()
    [0x4040]
