====

KSE (Kymera Simulation Environment) is a Python-based command shell for 
interactive prototyping, testing, and debugging of Kymera operators running 
in a simulated environment. When the shell is started, the session is loaded

The audio subsystem is simulated using kalsim/kalcmd2 (kalimba simulator).
