Components emulate some functionality outside of kymera which is needed in kalsim emulation.

.. _persistent_storage:

Persistent Storage
------------------

To use the Persistent Storage it has to be enabled on invocation (by adding ``--pstore_use`` in the command line).

The default location for pstore is config/pstore.cfg.json and the file is empty. The different file can be specified by adding ``--pstore_filename VAL`` in the command line.

The data can be stored in the pstore in the following format::

    [
        [
            1,
            [
                0,
                1
            ]
        ],
        [
            2,
            [
                4
            ]
        ]
    ]

pstore with this content will contain two keys, key id 1 with value [0, 1] and key id 2 with value [4].
