Workspace
---------

The workspace is pointed through the environmental variable ``$KATS_WORKSPACE``,
which need to be set before launching the KSE shell.

The workspace should have been populated with the following subdirectories:

* ``config``. Where configuration files reside
* ``firmware``. For kalimba firmware files
* ``log``. Where log files are placed
* ``resource``. Sample audio files
* ``script``. User script files location to be used with kalsim_shell or as user test scripts
* ``tmp``. Location for test audio output and coredump files

.. note:: The folder ``firmware`` - For kalimba firmware files - has to be manually
          generated inside the KSE standalone installation. Inside the ADK installation
          the folder ``firmware`` is generated automatically in a different location.
