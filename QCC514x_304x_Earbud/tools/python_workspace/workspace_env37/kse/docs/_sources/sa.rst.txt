Standalone
==========

Standalone is when KSE is running on its own without an ADK.

Installation
------------

The preferred installation method is using a dedicated virtual environment and
manage packages with pip, which is bundled in the Windows python installer
starting from version 3.4.

**Requisites**

If you donâ€™t have pip installed, you can easily install it by downloading
`get-pip.py <https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py>`_ and running::

    $ python get-pip.py


**Virtual environment**

To create a virtual environment, move where you want to create your directory and execute::

    C:\> py -3 -m venv kse
    $ python3 -m venv kse

.. note:: When presented python, a substitution for the full python path is a safer way to create
    virtual environments

That will create a venv directory with python binaries. Remember that is not a full python
installation it is an environment with links to your real python installation but with a detached
set of packages.


To activate the virtual environment execute::

    C:\> kse\Scripts\activate.bat
    $ source kse/bin/activate (on Linux bash)
    $ source kse/bin/activate.csh (on Linux tcsh)

.. note:: Every time you want to use the virtual environment it has to be previously activated in
    your shell


**Install KSE**

Ensure you are using updated versions of pip and setuptools::

    $ python -m pip install -U pip setuptools

Locate within the installed Qualcomm ADK and ADK Toolkit the following files:

    * ``kse-0.19.0-py3-none-any.whl`` available inside ``<ADK_version>`` folders
    * ``kalcmd2-2.8.2-py2.py3-none-any.whl`` available inside ``<ADK_Toolkit_version>`` folders

Copy these files into the current directory and execute::

    $ pip install kse-0.19.0-py3-none-any.whl kalcmd2-2.8.2-py2.py3-none-any.whl

Linux tcsh shell might require deactivation and activation of the virtual environment
after installation::

    $ deactivate
    $ source kse/bin/activate.csh


**Copy firmware**

The KSE standalone does not include any sample firmware. The firmware will be
provided separately (as inside the ADK debugbin directory).
Create a directory called ``firmware`` inside the ``workspace`` and copy the firmware files into
``kse/workspace/firmware``


Execution
---------

In case not active, open a cmd prompt and activate the virtual environment.
Set the workspace for the KSE shell by the following command::

    C:\> set KATS_WORKSPACE=<FULL PATH TO kse>\workspace   (On Windows command prompt)
    $ export KATS_WORKSPACE=<FULL PATH TO kse>/workspace   (On Linux bash shell)
    $ setenv KATS_WORKSPACE <FULL PATH TO kse>/workspace   (On Linux tcsh shell)

Launch the kse_shell by executing e.g. the following command:

For platform Stretto::

    kse_shell --platform stre --ks_path kalsim_qcc512x_audio --ks_firmware firmware/kymera_stre_audio --log_level 20 --hydra_ftp_server_directory firmware

For platform Strettoplus::

    kse_shell --platform streplus --ks_path kalsim_qcc514x_audio --ks_firmware firmware/kymera_streplus_audio --log_level 20 --hydra_ftp_server_directory firmware

For platform Maorgen1::

    kse_shell --platform maorgen1 --ks_path kalsim_qcc516x_audio --ks_firmware firmware/kymera_maor_audio --log_level 20 --hydra_ftp_server_directory firmware

For platform Maor::

    kse_shell --platform maor --ks_path kalsim_qcc517x_audio --ks_firmware firmware/kymera_maor_audio --log_level 20 --hydra_ftp_server_directory firmware
