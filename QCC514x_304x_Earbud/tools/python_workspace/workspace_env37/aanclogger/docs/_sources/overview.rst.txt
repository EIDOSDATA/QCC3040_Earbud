Overview
++++++++

``aanclogger`` is a python library that is provided with the Qualcomm ADK that wraps ``ACAT`` to
provide an interface to plot operator attributes in real time from one or two running chips. It is
primarily developed to assist in the design and tuning of kymera graphs running adaptive ANC (AANC)
on QCC514x+/QCC304x+.

The package provides an executable, ``aanclogger.exe``, that can be used to launch ACAT and enter
the logging environment.
